A building fell on me
Crushed my will
And took my breath ooh ooh

How could I have known
The windows would be closed
There was nowhere to leave
There was nowhere to go

The endlessness of lines
Drawn across time
Wrapped my finger to you
But you've gone beyond ooh ooh

I went back to look for you
Sifting through the living room, the living room
Fell into a hopeless nest

Misery tattooed
You
Back in back in
You're never coming back
No matter what

The endlessness of lines
Broken like twine
Drawn across time
In a pointless line

A building fell on me
Crushed my will
And took by breath
Away from me ooh ooh
